## About Me
Hello! I'm **Omar Gomaa**, a **beginner software developer** with a strong passion for learning and building practical applications.  
I am just starting my journey in programming, but I am enthusiastic about gaining more experience and improving my skills step by step.

I am familiar with several programming languages and technologies including:

- **Python** – for general-purpose programming, scripts, and small applications.  
- **Java** – learning object-oriented programming and building desktop or backend applications.  
- **JavaScript** – for adding interactivity and logic to web pages.  
- **HTML & CSS** – for creating the structure and styling of websites.  
- **Sass & Bootstrap** – to make websites more organized, responsive, and visually appealing.  
- **Git & GitHub** – for version control and sharing my projects online.  

Even though I am a beginner, I am highly motivated to **learn new technologies**, **practice coding daily**, and gradually **build real-world projects** that showcase my growing skills.

## My Learning Journey
I believe that learning programming is a step-by-step process. I focus on understanding the **concepts behind the code**, not just copying and pasting solutions.  
Currently, I am exploring **full-stack web development**, which includes both **frontend** (how websites look and feel) and **backend** (how data is stored and managed).  

Some of my current goals are:

- Improve my skills in **Python and Java** for backend development.  
- Build interactive web pages using **JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Sass, and Bootstrap**.  
- Learn how to **deploy applications** online and manage projects with **Git & GitHub**.  
- Contribute to small **open-source projects** to gain practical experience.

## My Approach
I try to **code every day**, even small exercises, because I believe consistency is the key to improvement.  
I enjoy experimenting with new tools and libraries, reading documentation, and following tutorials to understand how things work.  

Even as a beginner, I understand the importance of:

- Writing **clean and maintainable code**.  
- Planning projects before coding.  
- Debugging and problem-solving step by step.  
- Asking for help and learning from others in the programming community.
